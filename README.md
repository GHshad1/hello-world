# hello-world
MY FIRST ONE
Hi Everyone,
I am an agricultural scientist, but I am doing more data analyses these days, more like a biometrician. I will start my new position as a data analyst in July 2018. I am basically an R user and like to learn more and more about data analyses. My final goal is to be an expert in R and data analysis in biological science.
Wish me luck.
